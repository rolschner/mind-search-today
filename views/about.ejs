				<ul>
				<li>For anyone suffering from a mental health condition</li>

              Most likely it is that there is just so much information out there on the web and it is quite
              decentralized, thus you get anxious and frustrated among other feelings and probably wish there was a tool
              out there that could allow you to streamline and make this process easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well look no further! Mind Search is here to help, we are a local directory in the DMV area that will
              allow you to search up and locate your mental health provider by city and state.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are currently in our build phase and plan to work with local providers in the area to streamline this
              process to relieve this pain point once and for all!
              <strong>STAY TUNED, WE ARE CURRENTLY IN BUILD PHASE!</strong>
